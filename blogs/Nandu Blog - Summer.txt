There are flowers blooming, fruits ripening, the sun shining as strong as the message of happiness that sings. But we forget about the leaves desiccating, the roots drying, the withering lands and the threat of dehydration and death. What am I to become this summer? Shall I arise or perish? Shall I become one of the blossoming flowers or those leaves losing color, I thought as much.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The days are longer. The scorching heat never failing to make me blush. For a moment, it\'s peaceful to imagine a cold winter\'s breeze on your skin, on your hair, in your lungs. But once you open your senses back to reality, the air is warm and suffocating, for someone who wishes for darkness and depth. For moonlight and brilliance.<br></div><div><br></div><div>I hear my neighbor scolding her son for being late home after going to play outside. Vacation it is for them, for when the only nightmare they have is of the summer activity the school had given them. The son might be sad now for getting scolded but he will realize in future that those were the summer he was really happy. Those summers where he had no worry, where he had no air smothering him, where he could easily forget about the rays of heat strangling him.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Summer is such an irony. It is bittersweet. It is still and moving at once. Sometimes, watching the night sky I fall deep into thoughts. To be pulled into the freezing vacuum of space, to be claimed by the galaxies and to explode into nothingness is what I dream of. To travel as stardust, to exist as light and dark at once. To define calm and chaos at once. To yearn for love and hate at once. Is that not the nature of life? A series of paradox that tries to drive you to insanity. Sprinting and dodging away from it had been tiring, so why not try to own this sickness of existing?<br></div><div><br></div><div>But maybe one needs is a little shower of rain. Of satisfaction. Of temporary salvation. The dark clouds being the curtains of the sky. The world transforming from bright to dull. I know of people who hate that sudden change. They say they feel threatened and afraid, like something bad is going to happen. It is funny how movies have influenced them too much, how dark clouds and strong rainfall can only mean harm. That it is a sign of bad omen. Sad to be them, I often tell myself, as I wish upon a curtain of darkness and rain to save me from evaporating into the hollow of others happiness, to save me from this intricate intensity of color disguised as a rainbow. I wish upon that curtain to hold me onto the earth, to keep myself from vaporizing into something else, to make me want to live, to finish what I started. Maybe eventually find a purpose to navigate through this summertime sadness.<br></div><div><br></div><div>But do I wish for it to be gone? For the summer to not exist? For a season to delete itself from the lands? I asked myself one day. I would say no. I might like for it to be gone, but what would rain and winter be without the hard sufferings of summer? Only the wrongs of summer makes me want to hope for rain, and wait for winter.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The happiness that is born out of despair and sorrow. The yin and yang. The art of coexisting. I now knew that summer is what I really wanted to make me realize the blessing of rain and cold.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Honestly, this isn\'t about summer or winter or monsoon. This isn\'t about the heat or cold or the seasons. This isn\'t about the earth revolving around the sun. Or about the ice creams I crave when sweat builds in my back on an summer afternoon.<br></div><div><br></div><div>I think I know what it is about.<br></div>
