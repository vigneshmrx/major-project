A comedy for people who criticize punchlines. A fantasy most can\'t understand, a spectacle no one can deny. Lines are blurred. Heroes are villains. Budgets are cut. Business is business. But it can also be a land where Dead men walk. Where Honor makes you Elite. Where Demons run for office. And Rock Bottom is a reason to rejoice. WOOOOO! It\'s an escape. A reason to point the blame at anyone but yourself for 2-3 hours. An excuse to be a kid again, and nothing matters except the moment we are in. Wrestling is not just a love story, it\'s much more. It\'s hope. And in a world surrounded in hate, greed and violence, a world where closure may never come. We all know a place that has hot and cold hope on tap. For better or for worse.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><b>In the loving embrace of the arena, where perspiration meets the canvas, a display of strength, a symphony of skill unfolds.
