What will i do if I die early?

This is an interested but scary topic. I don't know why, but I have though about this.<div><br><div><br></div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">"<b>What will I do if I die early?</b>"</span></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br></div><div style="text-align: left;">I mean, who procrastinates about themselves dying? I do. I love to think about these things, I don't know why. I overthink because I believe overthinking solves my problems. Different people may have different views on this.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br></div><div style="text-align: left;">So, if I die early, I want to be a free soul who can roam around anywhere anytime they want. I hope I am a free soul who is not bounded by god and has the freedom to do anything.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="background-color: var(--main-white);">I love planets, so the first thing I will do is go and visit some planets like Mars, Neptune etc. I would also love to visit out nearest start system, the Alpha Centauri, which is about 4.4 Light Years from earth.</span><br></div></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br></div><div style="text-align: left;">Imagine these things, wouldn't it be great? Being able to visit different planets? Freedom to be at Mars in the morning and Jupiter in the afternoon?</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br></div><div style="text-align: left;">Other thing which I would do is go visit my friends. I will sit beside them, listening to them talk to others. Hopefully, they do miss me and talk to others about me, ðŸ˜‚. I will see my friends get happy, and be happy.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br></div><div style="text-align: left;">I have not actually though about being born again as a human though. I don't think I want it right now. So I would love to visit my friends and family, see their next generation and their next generation growing, making mistakes, learning and having a good life.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br></div><div style="text-align: left;">I feel, this is the best thing for me, being a ghost and seeing others. I will also visit other places on earth which I was not able to visit when I was alive. Think about this, you don't need to stand in queue for anything. Just fly and go to wherever you want. Wouldn't it be amazing?</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br></div><div style="text-align: left;">You can call me impractical or crazy or whatever you like, but it is what it is. If I die early, I would definitely want to do these things out of my own freedom and not be bound to any god or any other celestial being.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br></div><div style="text-align: left;">To all my readers, think about these kinds of things sometimes, you will love it. They are actually not as scary as you may think. They are just a thought in the end.</div>
